If you want, I can also:

Make a minimal elite “startup style” README version

Or make a highly technical documentation version

Or add shields (build status, license badges, tech badges)

Tell me which level you want.

🔐 Google Sign-In Setup ----------------------- To enable authentication: 1. Create a project in Google Cloud Console 2. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID 3. Add Authorized JavaScript Origin: Code https://CODING-to-void.github.io 4. Replace the `data-client_id` value inside `index.html` No backend required.

no like thse personal thing we dont wanna say 

Understood. You want it clean and professional, without personal instructions or setup details like Google Cloud steps.

Here is a polished, production-style README section replacing that part.

You can paste this directly into your README.md.
