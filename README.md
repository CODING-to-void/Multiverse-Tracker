## ✦ Design Philosophy

> Every pixel is intentional. Every interaction is considered.

The interface is built on a **dark luxury aesthetic** — deep charcoal backgrounds, warm gold accents, subtle grain textures, and silky smooth transitions. Typography pairs `Cormorant Garamond` for editorial elegance with `Jost` for crisp readability and `DM Mono` for data precision.

| Design Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary Background | `#09090b` — near-absolute black |
| Gold Accent | `#c8a96e` — muted antiquarian gold |
| Text Primary | `#e2ddd6` — warm off-white |
| Semantic Green | `#4a9e7e` — muted sage |
| Semantic Blue | `#5e8fb8` — dusty steel |
| Semantic Purple | `#8a6ec4` — deep violet |

<br/>

## ✦ Knowledge Graph — The Crown Jewel

The interactive **Knowledge Graph** is what sets Multiversal Tracker apart. Powered by a lightweight NLP engine, it:

- 🧠 **Auto-suggests connections** between your notes and concepts
- 🖱️ **Drag, pan & zoom** a fully interactive canvas
- 🔗 **One-click linking** to build your personal knowledge web
- 🎯 **Node type tagging** — distinguish Concepts, People, Events & more
- 💡 **AI-powered overlap scoring** — finds hidden relationships in your content

## ✦ Philosophy & Acknowledgements

Multiversal Tracker is born from the belief that **tools for thinking should themselves be beautiful**. Academic software doesn't have to feel sterile or corporate. Your second brain deserves an interface that inspires the work it contains.

Built with love, caffeine, and an obsessive attention to detail.
